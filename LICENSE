CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under CC0, thereby affording all of the
permissions granted under CC0 to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law.

Affirmer's Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

1. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
   for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or the absence of latent or
   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or
   not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable
   law.

2. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
   limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
   Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
   consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

3. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
   to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0
   or use of the Work.
